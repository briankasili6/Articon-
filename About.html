                My artwork takes a critical view of social, political and cultural issues. Often referencing Black history, my work explores the varying relationships between popular culture and fine art.
                Articon_Inc was born as a simple idea for my artwork. Its main aim is to create a story out of the artworks that are made often referencing black history with varying relationships between
                 popular culture and fine art. While I use a variety of materials and processes in each project my methodology is consistent. Although there may be material similarities between the different 
                 projects they are linked by recurring formal concerns and through the subject matter. The subject matter of each body of work determines the materials and the forms of work. Each project often
                 consists of multiple works, often in a range of different media, grouped around specific themes and meanings. During research and production new areas of interest arise and lead to the next body of work.
